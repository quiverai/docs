## Making a request

Here's a simple example how to generate an SVG from a text prompt.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript javascript
import QuiverAI from "quiverai";
const client = new QuiverAI();

const logo = await client.svgs.generations.create({
  model: "arrow-0.5",
  input: "A logo for the next AI Design startup",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Writing prompts

To achieve the best results and have more nuanced creative control, include the following elements in your prompt:

- **Subject:** Who or what is in the image? Be specific. (e.g., a logo for a eco-friendly coffee brewery; a business illustration displaying two teammates collaborating).
- **Color Palette:** Which colors should be used? (e.g., [#03045e 0077b6, 00b4d8, 90e0ef,  caf0f8], background: e9edc9 and logo in fb8500).
- **Style:** What is the overall aesthetic? (e.g., line art, hand drawn, duotone).
- **Specific text integration:** Clearly state what text should appear and how it should look. (e.g., "The headline 'URBAN EXPLORER' rendered in bold, white, sans-serif font at the top.")
- **Editing Instructions:** For modifying an existing image, be direct and specific. (e.g., turn this photo into an illustration)
