## Arrow models

QuiverAI currently provides a stable model and a preview build:

| Model | Best for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `arrow-0.5` | Text-to-SVG generation, style-consistent icons and illustrations | Stable API behavior. Recommended default. |
| `arrow-0.5-preview` | Trying the newest improvements early | Preview outputs may change and can be less stable than the default model. |
