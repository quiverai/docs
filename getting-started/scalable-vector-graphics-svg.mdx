title: 'Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)'
---

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format. Unlike raster images (PNG/JPEG), SVGs scale cleanly to any size, making them ideal for logos, icons, illustrations, and UI assets.

## Why SVG matters

- **Crisp at any resolution**: Perfect for responsive UIs and high-DPI displays.
- **Editable**: You can tweak colors, strokes, and paths in design tools or code.
- **Small and fast**: Well-optimized SVGs can be lightweight and compress well.
- **Programmable**: CSS and JS can style and animate SVGs.

## Core concepts

- **`viewBox`**: Defines the internal coordinate system. A good `viewBox` makes your SVG easy to scale and position.
- **Paths and shapes**: Most generated SVGs are a mix of `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, etc.
- **Fill and stroke**:
  - Use `fill` for solid areas.
  - Use `stroke` for outlines (with `stroke-width`, `stroke-linecap`, etc).

## Using generated SVGs safely

- **Sanitize untrusted SVGs**: If you render SVGs coming from untrusted sources, sanitize them first (SVGs can embed scripts).
- **Prefer inline SVG for theming**: Inline SVG lets you style with CSS variables and class names.
- **Optimize for production**: Run output through an optimizer (for example SVGO) if you need smaller payloads.

## Tips for better results with QuiverAI

- **Be explicit about style**: e.g. “flat monochrome icon”, “duotone illustration”, “clean geometric lines”.
- **Constrain aspect ratio**: Use `aspect_ratio` to get predictable layouts.
- **For image vectorization**: Crop tightly, and use `auto_crop` only as a fallback when you can’t crop manually.
