Here's a simple example how to generate an SVG from a text prompt.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript javascript
import QuiverAI from "quiverai";
const client = new QuiverAI();

const logo = await client.svgs..generations.create({
  model: "arrow-0.5",
  input: "A logo for the next AI Design startup",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Preparing the image

To achieve the best result, cropping an image can significantly improve the model's performance.
