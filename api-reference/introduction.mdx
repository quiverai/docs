<Note>
  This API reference describes the RESTful, streaming, and realtime APIs you can use to interact with the QuiverAI platform. REST APIs are usable via HTTP in any environment that supports HTTP requests.
</Note>

## Authentication

The QuiverAI API uses API keys for authentication. Create and manage API keys in the [QuiverAI Platform](https://platform.quiver.ai) or follow the [Quickstart Guide](/getting-started/quickstart).

**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). API keys should be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service on the server.

```json
Authorization: Bearer <QUIVERAI_API_KEY>
```
