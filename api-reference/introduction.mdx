<Note>
  This API reference describes the RESTful, streaming, and realtime APIs you can use to interact with the QuiverAI platform. REST APIs are usable via HTTP in any environment that supports HTTP requests.
</Note>

## Authentication

The QuiverAI API uses API keys for authentication. Create and manage API keys in the [QuiverAI Platform](https://platform.quiver.ai) or follow the [Quickstart Guide](/getting-started/quickstart).

**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). API keys should be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service on the server.

```json
Authorization: Bearer <QUIVERAI_API_KEY>
```

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to: `https://api.quiver.ai/v1`

## Request and response format

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. Include the `Content-Type: application/json` header in all requests.

## Rate limits

The API enforces rate limits to ensure platform stability. If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff and respect the `Retry-After` header when present.

## Error handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes and JSON error payloads:

- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid or missing API key
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

Error responses include a `type`, `message`, `code`, and `param` field to help you debug issues.

## Official SDKs

We provide an official Node.js SDK. For other languages, use standard HTTP requests.

```bash filename
npm install @quiverai/sdk
```
